Here you will find the codes that enable countries with commercial interests in danish waters to provide data on their fishing 
fleets landings and effort in areas selected as possible future MPAs. 

"1_Aggregate_and_write_output.R" can be run directly if your country already has a combined VMS/Logbook file in the tacsatEflalo format.
If not, the two scripts "00_CleanTacsat_Eflalo.R" and "0_CombineTacsatAndEflalo.R" suggest a method for combining the two. VMS and Logbooks
can be combined in several ways, so it is your responsibility to choose the method best suited for your country. For more information 
see https://github.com/nielshintzen/vmstools/wiki.

The following informations are requested within the proposed areas and by ICES square:
-	Landings (total weight in KG) and landing values (Euro) by species, year and gear code
-	Effort (hours) by year and gear code
-	Number of unique vessels in each area by year for mobile bottom contacting gears and for other gears. 

The following informations are requested within the proposed areas:
-	VMS data positions with assumed fishing activity (after speed filter is applied) by year and gear code 

Thank You for filling out the requested form.
