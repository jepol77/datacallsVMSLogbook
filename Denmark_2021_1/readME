Here you will find the codes that enable countries with commercial interests in danish waters to provide data on their fishing 
fleets landings and effort in areas selected as possible future MPAs. 

"1_Aggregate_and_write_output.R" can be run directly if your country already has a combined VMS/Logbook file in the tacsatEflalo format.
If not, the two scripts "00_CleanTacsat_Eflalo.R" and "0_CombineTacsatAndEflalo.R" suggest a method for combining the two. VMS and Logbooks
can be combined in several ways, so it is your responsibility to choose the method best suited for your country. For more information 
see https://github.com/nielshintzen/vmstools/wiki.

Requested data is for the five sites mentioned below. Corresponding shapefiles can be found here: .
-	“Lønstrup Rødgrund” – EU site code: DK00VA301, located in ICES-square 43F9
-	“Thyborøn stenvolde” – EU site code: DK00VA348, located in ICES-square 42F7
-	“Jyske Rev, Lillefiskerbanke” - EU site code: DK00VA257, located in ICES-squares 42F6 and 42F7
-	“Store Rev” - EU site code: DK00VA258, located in ICES-square 44F9
-	“Gule Rev” - EU site code: DK00VA259, located in ICES-squares 43F7 and 43F8.

In addition, we also request data for the following ices squares: "42F6", "42F7", "43F6", "43F7", "43F8", "43F9", "44F8" and "44F9" (see figure 1). 


The following informations are requested within the proposed areas and by ICES square:
-	Landings (total weight in KG) and landing values (Euro) by species, year and gear code
-	Effort (hours) by year and gear code
-	Number of unique vessels in each area by year for mobile bottom contacting gears and for other gears. 

The following informations are requested within the proposed areas:
-	VMS data positions with assumed fishing activity (after speed filter is applied) by year and gear code 

Thank You for filling out the requested form.
